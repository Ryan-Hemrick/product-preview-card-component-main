## My process
- Creating the product preview card component was my first HTML & CSS project in a fairly long time. I wanted to approach this project with a 'beginner' mindset and utilize existing knowledge and practice using FlexBox.
- Utilized FlexBox to create the layout. From there, I used basic CSS properties and values to make the component match the provided designs.
- Used media queries to adjust the layout and spacing for mobile devices


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS with FlexBox
- No custom properties


### What I learned
- LATER
