## My process
- Creating the product preview card component was my first HTML & CSS project in a fairly long time. I wanted to approach this project with a 'beginner' mindset and utilize existing knowledge and practice using FlexBox.
- Utilized FlexBox to create the layout. From there, I used basic CSS properties and values to make the component match the provided designs.
- Used media queries to adjust the layout and spacing for mobile devices


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS with FlexBox
- No custom properties


### What I learned
- A deeper understanding of practical FlexBox use
- Refreshed my memory on a bunch of CSS properties
- Refreshed my memory of using Git and GitHub
- There are A LOT of new CSS features that I need to learn about and start implementing in future projects. 

### What's next?
- Continue practicing layouts with FlexBox
- Read up on accessibility best practices
- Learn about custom variables
- Refactor this code (down the line)
- Complete another 'Newbie' FrontEnd Mentor project
